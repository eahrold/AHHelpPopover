Then add that identifier (key) and correlated help text to your LocalizedStrings.strings file.\n\n To include a title simply append the key with the suffix \"Title\" in your localized string file, and define what the title should be.\n\nTo include a url do the same, but suffix with \"URL\".\n\nFor an example see the LocalizedStrings.strings file inside this project.";

It's also been centered using the textAlignment property of the AHHelpPopover object." ;
